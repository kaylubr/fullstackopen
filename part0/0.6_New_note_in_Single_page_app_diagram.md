Note: The browser sends a post request to the server. The server handles the form data and converts it into a JSON format. When the browser receives a response, it receives a JSON type file that contains the data of the note that was submitted. Also, the document does not reload or redirect to a new webpage. Instead, it dynamically add the note in the notes page.
